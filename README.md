## Dipesh Kumar's Portfolio Website

Welcome to the my portfolio website's GitHub repository! This site is a showcase of my technical skills and creativity, meticulously crafted using the Eleventy (11ty) static site generator, integrated with the sleek and responsive Tailwind CSS, and enhanced with basic JavaScript for dynamic interactivity. Designed to be both visually appealing and highly functional, this portfolio not only displays my past projects and professional journey but I have also tried to follow good practices. Dive in to explore the code, understand the structure, and feel free to get inspired for your own projects!

I also plan on creating a 11ty starter out of this for anyone who wants to get started fast and reduce the overhead of doing the same things again and again.
