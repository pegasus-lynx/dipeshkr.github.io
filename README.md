## Dipesh Kumar's Portfolio Website

#### Tech Stack

This has been a hard decision and now I think I should not have wasted so much time. Well, if I wouldn't have I would never find **11ty : Eleventy**.

#### Major Commits

- __commit_hash_1__ - Basic website using `11ty` framework
- __commit_hash_2__ - Integrated `Tailwind CSS` support.

#### Articles and Blogs 
In this section, I am including all the articles that I have used to build this website. Apart from these, I also too reference from other blogs, but found these to be the easiest ones to follow.

- [Detailed Guide to build a 11ty / eleventy & tailwindCSS static site](https://5balloons.info/guide-tailwindcss-eleventy-static-site/)


##### Other Blogs

- [Adding Tailwind CSS to 11ty](https://hiltonmeyer.com/articles/add-tailwind-11ty.html) - Excellent blog, but includes the use of parcel. I don't have anything against Parcel, it's just that I wanted to keep the dependencies to the minimum.

#### How should I structure the website
