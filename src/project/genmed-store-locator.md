**GenMed: Store Locator** is a **Django**-based web application I developed to 
bridge the gap between consumers and affordable healthcare. This 
platform serves as a convenient tool for locating generic medicine 
stores, offering cost-effective alternatives with the same composition 
as branded medicines.

At the core of this application is a **MySQL database**, which holds detailed 
information about various store locations and their inventory. I integrated 
Bing Maps API to facilitate an intuitive, map-based store locator feature. 
This allows users to easily find the nearest stores, sorted by their distance 
from the user's location.

A key functionality of GenMed is its medicine inventory search, enabling users 
to find stores based on medicine availability. This feature significantly 
enhances user convenience, particularly in urgent situations.

Developing GenMed was also a journey of learning and skill enhancement for me. 
It involved mastering **Django** and **Python**, along with front-end technologies 
like **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Jinja**, and deepening my understanding of database 
management with **MySQL**.
