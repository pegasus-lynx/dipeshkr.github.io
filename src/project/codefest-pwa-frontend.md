**Codefest** was a annual departmental fest of our Computer Science branch. For Codefest'19, we made a Vue.js-powered PWA with matrix theme.

1. Collaborated with the frontend team to build a PWA for the Codefest website.
2. Implemented State Management pattern using Vuex.
3. Build a web terminal from scratch, with the help of Promises.

Later, we also overhauled the whole frontend theme of the webapp to a more **Harry Potter** based site.
