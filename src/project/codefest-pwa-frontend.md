**Codefest** is the annual Computer Science department fest at IIT (BHU). 
For Codefest'19, we embraced the theme of __The Matrix__ movie and developed a Vue.js-powered Progressive Web App (PWA). Our goal was to deliver a high-performance web application that offers a seamless and native experience on mobile devices as well.

As a key member of the frontend team, my role involved applying various 
UI/UX design principles to ensure a cohesive experience across mobile 
and desktop platforms. My contributions included styling the web application 
UI and designing innovative components like a __mobile-specific notch__, 
__a glitch effect for icons__, and __creating complex shapes using SVGs__.


### Interesting Features

- One standout feature of this project was a terminal interface at 
the bottom of the page, enabling users to navigate the webapp in a 
novel way. This cool addition was masterfully implemented by 
**_Shivansh Saini_** â€“ kudos to his brilliant work!

- In the following year, we gave the webapp a complete makeover. 
Drawing inspiration from **_Harry Potter_**, we introduced a 
**_Marauder's Map_** as the centerpiece for the desktop version, 
adding an exciting twist to the user experience.
